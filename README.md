# Next.js Tutorial

Demo project to learn and create an example Next.js project. The project consists of two parts: frontend and backend.

For backend I use Node.js and Express.js. 

For frontend it is Next.js.

Folder structure:

```
    be          folder for backend (Express.js app)
        app     root for backend app
    fe          folder for frontend (Next.js app)
        app     root for frontend app
```
